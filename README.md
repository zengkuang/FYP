Hackers, please add your model under ./code and create our own folder for the very model. For example, if wish to add a image inpainting model, name it ./code/non_learning_inpainting.

Testing images are located under ./sample_img. There are few to select from. Feel free to push any other images as possible and name it in the order of "image1", "image2" etc. 

Dataset Access: to be uploaded
